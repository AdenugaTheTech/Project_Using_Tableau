## Project Brief

**Project**: CAR SALES DASHBOARD

This is my TABLEAU project which was to show my TABLEAU skills and techniques. The project involved sales analysis and creating dynamic dashboard and answering business questions for decision making.


## The Situation
Our company is a car dealership that sells various car models. To effectively track and analyze our sales performance, we need a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard in Tableau. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car sales, helping us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.


## Problem Statement 1: KPIâ€™s Requirement

The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales trends. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and identify trends and opportunities for growth.

1. **Sales Overview:**:

i. **Year-to-Date (YTD) Total Sales**

```tableau
SUM(IF 
YEAR([Date]) = { FIXED : MAX(YEAR([Date]))}
THEN
[Price ($)]
END)
```

ii. **Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth in Total Sales**

```tableau

([YTD Total Sales] - [PYTD Total Sales ]) 
/ [PYTD Total Sales ]

```

2. **Average Price Analysis**:

i. **YTD Average Price**

```tableau
[YTD Total Sales] / [YTD Cars Sold]

```

ii. **YOY Growth in Average Price**

```tableau
([YTD Avg Price]-[PYTD Avg Price]) 
/ [PYTD Avg Price]

```


3. **Cars Sold Metrics**:

i. **YTD Cars Sold**

```tableau
SUM(IF 
YEAR([Date]) = { FIXED : MAX(YEAR([Date]))}
THEN
[Price ($)]
END)
```

ii. **YOY Growth in Cars Sold**

```tableau
([YTD Cars Sold] - [PYTD Cars Sold])
/ [PYTD Cars Sold]
```

## Problem Statement 2: Charts Requirement

- **YTD Sales Weekly Trend**: Display a line chart illustrating the weekly trend of YTD sales. The X-axis should represent weeks, and the Y-axis should show the total sales amount.
- **YTD Total Sales by Body Style**: Visualize the distribution of YTD total sales across different car body styles using a Pie chart.
- **YTD Total Sales by Color**: Present the contribution of various car colors to the YTD total sales through a donut chart.
- **YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region**: Showcase the YTD sales data based on different dealer regions using a bar chart to visualize the sales distribution geographically.
- **Company-Wise Sales Trend in Grid Form**: Provide a tabular grid that displays the sales trend for each company. The grid should showcase the company name along with their YTD sales figures.

## Conclusion

This is my TABLEAU project, covering exploratory data analysis and building interactive dashboard. The analysis from this project can help drive business decisions and better understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
